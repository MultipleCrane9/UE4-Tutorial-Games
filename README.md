# Udemy-UE4-Tutorial-Games
This repository is for my twitch followers to be able to follow along with me in the tutorials that I am going through. 
And thus they will need a place to be able to download any files that are given to me so that they can do just that.
Additionally, you will need to download Visual Studio Community 2019, Visual Studio Code, and the Unreal Engine 4 (Version 4.22.3) as these are the same versions that I will be using during the lessons.

- Visual Studio Community 2019 - [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/]
- Visual Studio Code - [https://code.visualstudio.com/]
- The Epic Games Downloader (This is how you get UE4) - [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/]

- Here is my Twitch where I will be streaming the courses as I go through them - [https://www.twitch.tv/multiplecrane9]
- And my Discord where you can chat with everyone and hang out, as well as participate in our non-game development streams - [https://discord.gg/GPXsvsy]
